StressLess

# Capacity - 2 Weeks Sprint

- **Tim (10 hours)**: Usually very busy until Wednesday. This Wednesday will be extra busy since I need to do a CA event. My Greek Ethics seminar is also ramping up the reading to about 60 pages per class day (2x a week). Thursdays to Sundays are less busy for me, and I can meet some time outside of class during these times (except 11am-12pm, 2-4pm, and after 7pm on Thursdays).
- **Alyssa (15 hours):** Slighty busy, but probably have a good amount time to work on this.  Can meet anytime after 6:30 pm M and T, after 4 pm on W,  before 11:30 am or 2:30-4 pm on T and TH, 4-5 on F, and can prob mostly do anytime Sa or Su.  Can also meet in mornings before 11 am M, W, and F.
- **Nifemi: (10 hours):** Flexible schedule, prefer to meet after 4pm during weekdays and anytime weekends.
- **Khanh (20 hours):** Free to meet from 4:00 - 8:00 PM every day except for Wednesday and Thursday. Do not have much stuff going on so can contribute a good amount of time on this sprint.
- **Madel (10 hours):** Basically free after 4PM on most days. Can make the time to work on this very flexibly.
- **Cheyanne(10 hours):** Mostly free, mondays: busy in the morning 10 to 12;  free from 12 to 2pm every MWF; class on T/TH from 2:30pm to 4 otherwise free those days; typically free after 4pm everyday
