# **1. Product Description with User Roles**

## Overview

Our app is called StressLess. The primary purpose of the app is to help users manage their time more easily and to create a customized schedule best accustomed to the user’s needs. The inspiration for the name is from the goal for users to feel less stressed with time management and create a schedule for individual users to best complete work and reduce stress. 

## **How It Works**

The first time the app is used, the user will fill out a survey that asks them about their preferences. The following preferences in the survey would be: time of day user prefers to study, sleep schedule, how they prefer to split up their studying time– if they prefer to study in chunks where they study for a little and take a break or if they prefer to get everything done in one sitting. 

After the user fills out the initial questionnaire, they will also be able to input their class schedule and other time commitments for a certain date range. After we are able to generate information on the person, then the app will be able to generate a customizable schedule. 

## **User Roles**

The primary user roles are students. It will mainly target middle school students, high school students, college students, grad school students, PhD students, or any student with a syllabus (i.e. structured deliverables and deadlines). 

Students will input the upcoming work and activities to the app and then the app will create the schedule. Students will then use the calendar to keep track of their time.

Even though this app is primarily designed for students syllabi, it could also be adapted to other audiences such as adults with a full time job, parents with commitments to take care of their children with household duties and bring them to various activities, and any other people who have busy schedules and need help managing their time. 

## Why this App is Useful

This app helps fulfill the college students' needs of time management because it helps students organize their time and keep track of specific tasks that they need to accomplish. The target users for this product are mainly college students. This app will be better than the already existing journals and calendars because it will create a personalized calendar based on questionnaires rather than the user manually inputting when they believe they will complete each individual assignment.

## Challenges

One challenge of our product is if the user either underestimates or overestimates the time they believe a specific assignment will take. Realistically, if a student incorrectly estimates how long certain assignments will take, the app will potentially miscalculate it and if it underestimates how long certain assignments will take, this means that the schedule won’t be accurate anymore because it needs more time for the assignment compared to its initial input. Therefore, users should be able to edit their time commitments in the app, so it can generate a new schedule.

Another challenge will be the personalization of the schedules. Because there are so many different options that users could enter, the app might get confused and miscalculate certain schedules. Being able to create an algorithm that works for all different types of users and preferences is challenging because of the infinite amount of options and possibilities. 

## Comparison to Previous Apps

This idea is different from previous scheduling and time management apps like Google Calendar,  focus apps like Pomofocus, and task management apps like Todoist because it creates automatic customizable schedules based on preferences rather than having schedules manually inputted in (Google, 2025; Cirillo, 2019; Salihefendić 2007). Google Calendar has users manually input their schedule of which tasks they will accomplish and when, Pomofocus lets the user manually choose how much time at a time they want to focus on homework in general, and Todoist is a checklist of tasks that the user must complete at certain times. 

Our app is different because it automatically creates a schedule to complete tasks based on each user’s personal preferences. Instead of creating a generic schedule for everyone, it is customizable because different people favor certain times and block time differently to do their work.

# 3. Non-Functional Requirements

1. User authorization is used to provide online sync/backup functionality as well as protecting unauthorized users from viewing schedules. The application should be usable offline.
2. The app can support multiple users at the same time with minimal latency.
3. When events are planned, they appear on the screen right away with no long lag or delay between planning and looking at the new events.
4. The calendar should be able to handle more than 1,500 planned events per user.

# 4. External Requirements

1. The product must handle invalid user input (like time overlaps, absurd amounts of events, etc.) gracefully during the initial survey step and syllabus scanning step (if implemented).
2. If the product can be used offline, its offline functionalities need to be robust. For example, all features involving viewing the calendar, managing events, generating routines, and notifications are available. User authorization for syncing will not be available.
3. The app will be available to Android and Apple mobile devices (cross-platform). On Android, we will distribute through an APK file. We may have difficulties distributing apps on iOS because of the requirement to have an Apple Developer account, which is not free. However, since our app uses cross-platform technologies, making the app available on iOS afterwards will be relatively easy.
4. We will code using a cross-platform technology like Expo or something similar to produce the mobile app. We will make sure to thoroughly document the build process. We will also document server setup instructions for any online functionality, such as authentication or backups.
5. Our MVP’s scope is appropriate for the semester, since we have several components to implement, including handling user input, making a scheduler algorithm, and designing an appropriate calendar interface.

# 5. Scope and Feature List

## 4+ major features you will implement. The major features should constitute a minimal viable product (MVP).

- Users can input activities (both recurring and one-time) they must do, including class time, assignments, extracurricular activities (including clubs, sports, etc.), work hours, meal times, and sleep times. Users can also input expected times needed to complete each activity that does not occur at fixed times.
- Users will fill out initial survey, so they can input preferences for when they are the most productive, when they want to have free time, when they want to sleep/wake up, and if they prefer working through their assignments for long periods of time or if they need small breaks in between.
- The app designs a weekly routine for a whole academic semester that caters to the user’s commitments as well as focus/productive time preference in a time-blocking manner.
- Users can update their planned activities and make the app regenerate the calendar.
- Notifications for upcoming deadlines, important events, etc.

## 2+ stretch goals you hope to implement.

- Scanning a syllabi/multiple different versions of syllabi
- Users can export the generated calendars to calendar apps like Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc.
- Checklist of assignments to check off when they’re completed

## 2+ features that are out of scope that you will not implement.

- Make a web application version
- A way to share the calendar with other people in the app
- A community for users to share their routines and advices
