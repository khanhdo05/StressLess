# Sprint Planning 3: Initial Release

# Overview

In this sprint, we will solidify the architecture and design of our product. We will write a testing plan, set up automated testing and continuous integration, and complete additional work toward the initial release.

# Capacity - 2 Weeks Sprint

- **Tim (10 hours until 4/8, 4 hours afterwards until end of sprint)**: I will spend more time this sprint since I spent less time than expected on the previous sprint. This week I do not have major deadlines, but I will start having semi-major deadlines next week. However, next week will likely be less intensive since we are focused on the demo. A significant portion of the 14 hours outside of class will likely be focused on intentionally reading documentation.
- **Alyssa (15 hours each week):** I should have time and be more available during this sprint compared to the last sprint. During the first week of the sprint I am available after 4 pm on Thursday and Friday. I also have a good amount of free time this weekend on both Saturday and Sunday to work on this. Second week can meet anytime after 6:30 pm M, T, W, and TH before 11:30 am or 2:30-4 pm on T and TH, 4-5 on F.  Can also meet in mornings before 11 am M, W, and F.
- **Nifemi: ( 15 hours this week):** I’m available to meet after 4pm everyday and I can meet most weekend in the afternoon.
- **Khanh (20 hours each week):** I’m available and willing to put in a lot of hours to get our MVP done and ready for the demo. I can meet on most days after 4pm and all morning on Friday, most of Saturday and Sunday.
- **Madel (12 hours):** I can meet on most days after 4pm and am basically free most weekends!
- **Cheyanne( 16 hours each week):** available on friday after 4pm, everyday after 4pm im free. Mostly free, mondays: busy in the morning 10 to 12;  free from 12 to 2pm every MWF; class on T/TH from 2:30pm to 4 otherwise free those days; typically free after 4pm everyday

# Goals

Our goal in this sprint is to get a working version of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) finished with fully tested and functional backend APIs and easy-to-navigate UI. To be specific, we want to achieve Landing Page, Sign-up/Sign-in, User Profile, Preference Questionnaire, Calendar View (that is similar to a clone of Google Calendar, there is no automatically scheduling algorithm in this demo).

### 1st Week

- Ensure that every team member has the relevant technologies set up on their laptop (especially the database technology)!
- Dockerized Express and PostgreSQL (DL: April 2 Evening)
- Write backend table schema (DL: April 3 Evening)
- Migrate frontend to use NextJs (DL: April 1 Evening)
- Set up backend Firebase Authentication implemented (DL: April 2 Evening)
- Landing Page that has Sign In/Sign Up UI components finished
- Basic routings and protected routings configured in the frontend
- Set up `faker` factories for ease of unit testing for each backend and frontend (DL: April 3 Evening)
- Backend `POST` `GET` methods for user management implemented and tested
- Backend `POST` `GET` methods for preference management implemented and tested
- Backend `POST` `GET` methods for calendar/events implemented and tested
- Onboarding preference questionnaire UI (Typeform for ease of implementation)
- Monthly calendar view implemented
- Weekly calendar view implemented
- Daily calendar view implemented
- Creation, editing, and deletion of events implemented

### 2nd Week

- Integrate the actual API call on the frontend for sign in/sign up
- Integrate the actual API call on the frontend for managing preference questionnaire
- Integrate the actual API call on the frontend for managing events and deadlines in  calendar view
- End-to-end test the flow of creating new user, filling out questionnaire, viewing calendar, adding/editing/deleting events/deadlines.
- Integrate Continuous Deployment
- Ensure that written components of Sprint Journal are completed
- Practice MVP Presentation

# Task Breakdown

https://trello.com/b/qHGNCIJI/stressless

See the issue tracker. Our tasks can be divided into these categories: Docker, Faker Testing Setup, Auth, Backend API Endpoints, Frontend Pages and Components.

We can divide our team up into Backend and Frontend and work simultaneously without conflicts during the first week. Essentially, we will have two team members mainly working on the frontend (Nifemi & Cheyanne) and four team members mainly working on the backend (Khanh, Madel, Alyssa, Tim). During the first week, we will have all the API endpoints tested and implemented and the UI finished with mock api call + populated fake data. Then during the second week, we will replace and integrate the actual API call in the frontend and make sure our MVP is deployed and ready for demo.
