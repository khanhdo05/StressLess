# ✅ Part 1 - Revise requirement from feedback

**1) Summarize the feedback from your reviews.**

The review feedback suggests for us to cut back on the complexity of our main feature, specifically the syllabus scanner, prompting us to move this feature to become a stretch feature. However, cutting out the syllabus scanner feature prompts us to make our idea more distinguishable from other calendar apps, like Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar.

**2) Describe the changes, if any, that you are making to your requirements, user personas, user stories, use cases, and prototype based on these reviews.**

Based on the reviews from our peers, we have decided to officially save the syllabus scanner feature to be a stretch feature solely implemented if we have extra time only. To make our idea distinguishable from other calendar apps, we have decided to make the stand-out feature of the app the ability for it to generate and personalize study and break times based on a given schedule and set of deadlines. 

**3) Describe your rationale in deciding what changes to make (or not make) based on the reviews.**

The reviews prompt us to focus more on the flexibility of scheduling in our app, specifically being able to customize personalized study and break times based on individual schedules and changes. Due to this new goal, we are now less focused on stretch features such as the scanner app and are instead going to put more of our efforts on scheduling flexibility.

2) Enumerate three use cases that the prototype models

1. **Use Case 2:** Max who is an overcommitter and wants to schedule a last minute club meeting
2. **Use Case 3:** Julie is a third-year nursing student on track to graduate with a BSN in four years who wants to best manage her time and scheduled 
3. **Use Case 4:**  Sheyené is a user who wants to change her last minute appointment to a different time.

## **Test Report with Professor Perlmutter**

wonders if the stressless is clickable, she didnt know she could scroll since theres no scroll bar, she goes to sign in, she tries to get a username that has already been taken, we didnt have a message to say the username was already taken, she choses a new username with the same password, the screen loads to show the inital survey, she tries to select mutiple options(wanted to do morning and evening, deep-work, between 8 or 9 hours and wonders if she can choose 8.5hrs) we prompt her to add an important deadline she chooses to add an event where she teaches class from 10-12 and 2-4 every MWF  and choses recurring and her description is to teach her class, she choses to add a deadline to make a poster and struggles trying to come up with a deadline, she starts planning out how long each step will take and estimates it was take 5 hours, she stars on sunday and plans to finish on wednesday, we noticed calendar was not correct for this month, she choses to edit a task, then delete the task, then she realized she didnt really want to delete it so she did not confirm the delete, she wonders when she can work on her poster, she supposes that the allocated times to finish the task will be able to edited more so she can be specific and choose how long it will take for each part of the process, she goes to the user profile, she wants to quickly add when she wakes up but she would have to retake the survey but can put in when she wakes up, she wants to give the StressLess her outlook calendar, wants it to account when she is not in the mood for work like she doesnt want to work after 8pm, suggests we can have an ( …)  in the prototype to show we have intentions to adding more questions, she wanted to change the icon in the user profile, she presses the plus button, she adds an event to travel to pittsburg at 9am central time to 5pm eastern time (where is it: starts in grinnell and ends in pittburg) she wants to work on the poster while she’s on the flight from 11:35 until 12:30, 4-5p and we tell her its a conflicting event and she choses to ignore this message since she wants to work on the two at the same time.

the user case Huyen was activated, since Leah wanted to manually enter obligations for her full-time job and said how she would like to sync the planner to my existing calendar on outlook

- The feedback you got from the test user.
    - Have study time be customizable for specific assignments rather than just generic study time

**Feedback From Question Session**

- Add a scroll bar.

**Version 1 of Questions Asked**

1. What is your first impression of the app’s design and layout?: 
    1. Looks clean, simple, and familiar. Buttons make sense. Plus button is conventional.
    2. The survey is unintuitive, since you could only retake survey but not edit individual answer.
2. Do you find the app easy to read/navigate?:
    1. See previous questions.
3. What do you think is the main purpose of the app?: 
    1. To “be my manager” and tell when you’re supposed to do each thing.
4. Were you able to complete tasks without confusing?: 
    1. Clarified in the end
    2. Confused about editing the survey.
    3. Wanted how many hours of sleep to be different by being able to specify when you want to sleep.
    4. Difficult to get enough information into the app.
        1. Already uses Outlook calendar. Importing might be useful
5. Do you think this app accomplishes that goal?:
    1. Not yet. But the trajectory is visible.
    2. Can you tell the app if you done something, or if you need to reschedule.
6. What emotions did you feel while interacting with this app?: 
    1. Focused in trying to understand what the buttons did
    2. Interested to creatively explore the app
    3. A little frustrated at inability to import calendar
    4. Confused at times but clarified.
7. What was the most confusing part or any part where you felt stuck or lost about the app?: 
    1. See previous questions.
8. What features do you find the most useful about the app?: 
    1. Not sure yet. Needs more convincing. Is not the ideal stakeholder. Already has experience scheduling events.
9. What features did you expect, but didn’t find?: 
    1. Reporting what you did or not did
    2. Importing calendar
    3. Adding more specific parameters.
10. What features do you find to be unnecessary?: 
    1. None so far.
11. Did the scheduling process feel smooth or tedious?: 
    1. Tedious.
    2. Will importing calendars help? Yes, but not sure if Prof. Perlmutter is the target user.
12. Do you think there is anything we can do to make this app stand out from other calendar apps such as Outlook calendar or Google Calendar?: 
    1. The goal is not really a calendar but to suggest when to schedule certain tasks.
    2. Prof: Thinks about delegating to actual calendar app and layering functionality on top.
13. What is one thing you would change about this app?: 
    1. Contribution is algorithm. In order to get meaningful feedback is to see a prototype about the algorithm. Like entering constraints and the output. How will you spread out the things over different days, etc.
    2. Prototyping an algorithm will different.
    3. Our algorithm is nontrivial.
14. What would you prefer to see on your schedule?:
    1. Not much to comment, since we made a canned example. Maybe modeling an algorithm may be useful.

Additional notes describing the session, e.g. observations of the test user's behavior.

- she was very whimsical and wanted to do a lot of in between answers and not follow the typical flow

# ✅ Part 4 - Test Practice (with a person in class)

## Test Report with Eliott

- A narrative describing the test: Eliott lands on the home page and scrolls. Clicks on get started and clicks signs up with Google. Eliott is given the survey. Selects the most productive times and selects preferred work pattern. Clicks the number of hours of sleep and sets to 8. Then continues to the next page. Then reads the add deadline/event screen. Clicks add deadline and fills in each answer. Next he adds an event and makes it recurring. Then confirms. Eliott is shown the calendar. Eliott wants to change an event. He clicks the + and add event button. Returns to the add event flow and confirms. Is presented alternative flow — conflicting event. Clicks conflicting event and opens event. Is confused on what clicking the event does. Then edits events and moves it back half an hour. Tries to add another event during an existing event. Ignores the conflict. Asks if you can auto-reschedule. Khanh explains that we will implement auto-reschedule in the future. Asks if you can re-calculate study time, etc. Opens the user page and reads the survey answers. Clicks the retake survey. Khanh explains survey will be redone. Reconfirms the survey, and then is prompted to add events. Does not add any new events and confirms. Eliott asks if we have notifications. Responds that it has not been implemented. Eliott asks when we need to take breaks. Responds that we will add a daily/weekly view. Eliott asks if we can add a pomodoro-style break system.
- What roles did each team member play during the test?
    - Tim: recorded test session.
    - Alyssa asked half of the follow-up questions and wrote answers.
    - Cheyanne asked the second half of the questions
    - Madel recorded the responses to the second half of the questions.

    - Use Case 1: Huyen (”As Huyen, I would like to be able to manually enter obligations that don’t come with a syllabus like my full-time job.”)
        - Elliot is able to manually add a deadline to his calendar.
    - Use Case 2: Max (”As Max, I need to be able to change my plans quickly with short notice so that I can do many things each day.”)
        - Elliot changes a conflicting event by moving it back an hour.
    - Use Case 4: Clementine (”As Clementine, I need a way to track deadlines and workout schedules in one place so that I can stay organized without feeling overwhelmed.”)
        - Elliot adds a deadline to the calendar interface.
    - Use Case 6: Sheyené (As Sheyené, I need to be able to update my schedule, so that if I get any new deadlines, I can update my schedule.)

- The feedback you got from the test user.
    - 3 major questions that you asked the test user for feedback on, and the test user's responses.
    - Spontaneous feedback from the test user, and questions you came up with on the spot

**Feedback From Question Session**

- Main takeaway is to add Google Calendar integration

**Version 2 of Questions Asked Modified Based on Revision of Test Procedure #1**

1. What is your impression of the app’s design and layout?: He likes the way that the prototype is set up (different colors & different buttons to interact with). He thinks we should change the calendar view to also include week views, day views, and just something to switch between views.
2. How do you find the process of navigating the app?: Navigation felt intuitive. However, the conflicting events part was confusing, and he had to try clicking around it order to figure it out.
3. What is the main purpose of the app? Do you think it accomplishes that purpose? : He thinks the main purpose is to automatically schedule study times and help students keep track of what they need to study for. He thinks that it accomplishes it that, but that one difficulty is the rescheduling of study sessions (i.e. in the case of skipping a study time due to laziness, task takes more time than anticipated, last-minute event comes up).
4. Does the app make you feel any negative feelings of confusion, frustration, or annoyance?: If a project takes longer than expected and the deadline is approaching, and there is no scheduled free time, the schedule can be overwhelming.
5. What was the most confusing part or any part where you felt stuck or lost about the app?: Conflicting events, changing events, plus button on calendar were confusing. For the plus button, he expected that it would take him to the next thing.
6. What features do you find the most useful about the app?: He likes the idea of the app dividing up the tasks you have into specific time slots based on your schedule, as it helps him get an overview of how much time he has to work on things.
7. What features did you expect, but didn’t find?: He expected to see the sign-up with Google to have Google Calendar integration (suggests an API to conduct this specific feature). 
8. How did you find the scheduling process?: He found the scheduling process easy and intuitive in adding events, but he sees this falling apart if we integrate Google Calendar.
9. How can we make this app stand out from other calendar apps such as Google Calendar?: Recommendations of sleep, work, and break times. He suggests that Google Calendar integration would be really important for him (as Google Calendar is still his main character).
10. What is one thing you would change about this app?: Google Calendar integration.

4) Notes on how to revise your testing procedure for the next user

(a) Not only will your prototype change, but also, you might choose to change the way you present it to your user.

# ✅ Part 5 - Test with Stakeholders

Add a section to your **Sprint Journal** for each test user describing:

- Who you tested it with.
    - Name, occupation, other relevant information about the test user
        - Istar - computer science and sociology major and senior
        - Nina - intended major physics and  German, freshman
        - Maral- computer science and statistics concentration and a second year
        - Elliot- computer science

        - Nina - Nina is a first year and college student as a student athlete who has a busy schedule on the tennis team who is a naive user
        - Maral - Maral adds diversity to our user cases as she is a current second-year, who has a different workload from first-year and fourth-year college students, as well as grad school students. Her experience will also reflect the workload of a STEM major (Computer Science) with a STEM concentration (Statistics).
        - Elliot- we chose Elliot since we wanted someone quickly and someone who doesn’t know any of us personally.
    - Date and time of the test session

## **Test Report 1 (Istar)**

- A narrative describing the test: Istar
    - we explained to her the purpose of our project and how we plan to schedule recurring events. First she signed up, and answered the intial survey as the following: zero hours of sleep every night, selected yes to upcoming deadline, said it will take her 3 hours to complete her math homework, she selected  that she plans to start her homework tonight at 8, initally she said she will finish the homework at 11 but we intended for it to be the due date a bit farther in the future and we explained that to her, then she said the due date is tomorrow.  Then we simulated that the event to do her math homework was added to the calender using the prototype. Then she wanted to delete an event so she clicked on it then we prompted her with the event details and she clicked delete, then the confirmation box appeared she clicked confirm and the task was deleted, she tried to move another event to where was already existed then and then a warning message appeared saying that an event is already scheduled at time. She then got the choice to ignore the warning and schedule anyways or cancel adding  the event at that time. Then she asked how she can sign out since there was no button to sign out. We noted done that we need a sign out button. Then she asked if she could print out her daily schedule and we said we don’t have a way to do that. We noted that adding a print out option to our stretch goals.  She asked how do i get back to the homepage, then we said this is the homepage. Finally she was finished and said “ok, i think i clicked every button”
    
    Areas For Improvement?: sign out, print out schedule, what is the homepage
    
- What roles did each team member play during the test?
    - Cheyanne took notes
    - Khanh simulated StressLess using the paper prototype
    - Tim explained purpose of StressLess after the user had their initial experience and asked the follow up questions
    - Alyssa and Nefemi asked the follow up questions
    - Madel made sure that we were taking notes and recording required parts of session
- Which user stories were activated?
    - Julie is the user story that was activated since Istar used StressLess to get a custom schedule integrating all of her set responsibilities
    - Bob user story since she wanted to add a lot of things to her schedule
    - Sheyené user story since her interations with the scheduler were quick and efficient

**Feedback From Question Session**

- We need a sign-up button, sign-out button, and daily (to-do list style) and weekly layout button.

**Version 1 of Questions Asked**

1. What is your first impression of the app’s design and layout?: It looks nice and she likes it. However, she’s wondering if there would be multiple layouts to display the calendar by (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
2. Do you find the app easy to read/navigate?: Yes, it feels simple to use.
3. What do you think is the main purpose of the app?: To keep students organized with their schedules.
4. Were you able to complete tasks without confusing?: Yes.
5. Do you think this app accomplishes that goal?: Yes.
6. What emotions did you feel while interacting with this app?: Curiousity. She did not what was going to pop up next, or what was the specific format of the app.
7. What was the most confusing part or any part where you felt stuck or lost about the app?: Conflicting schedule & survey questionnaire were confusing. Not sure which questions had choices and which one needed responses.
8. What features do you find the most useful about the app?: Compiling all your answers and creating a customized schedule.
9. What features did you expect, but didn’t find? Having a format where you could see the entire day (daily to-do list).
10. What features do you find to be unnecessary? No.
11. Did the scheduling process feel smooth or tedious? Smooth. Adding the scanner syllabus feature would be very useful.
12. Do you think there is anything we can do to make this app stand out from other calendar apps such as Google Calendar?: Syllabus scanner.
13. What is one thing you would change about this app? Adding other layouts (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
14. What would you prefer to see on your schedule?: I would like to see times when I should study in accordance with the rest of the items on my schedule.

## **Revision of Test Questions #1: Notes from Testing with Istar & Professor Perlmutter**

- Ask fewer questions so that user’s answers do not diminish in quality or user does not get overwhelmed
- Modify questions to be more expansive and less binary
- Ask user to be more critical about their feedback and notice flaws before the test begins

## **Test report #2 (Nina)**

- A narrative describing the test: Nina clicks "Get Started" and logs in to begin the survey. She selects morning as her most productive time and deep work as her preferred work pattern. For sleep duration, she enters 8 hours. Next, Nina adds a deadline. She types "Project" as the task name and "Math Homework" as the description, setting the duration to 1 hour. When prompted to enter the project time, she is unsure whether it should be a date or a number. She then adds a recurring event for tomorrow, titled "Math Class", but does not include a description. The app begins generating a schedule, displaying a "Please wait" message. While waiting, Nina asks if there is a button to mark tasks as complete. She also inquires about the ability to input total study hours for an exam (e.g., 15 hours for a midterm) and have the system automatically split it across multiple days. After the schedule is generated, she taps on the profile icon to view her profile, then navigates back to the calendar by tapping the calendar icon.
- What roles did each team member play during the test?
    - Alyssa animated while Nifemi took notes
    - Nifemi asked questions while Alyssa took notes
    - The rest of the team was absent due to conflicting time schedules
- Which user stories were activated?
    - the user story Max, a first-year college student was activated since Nina also wanted to schedule a lot of things like math homework, class and time to study for upcoming exam which similar to Max having a lot to add to his schedule.
    - the user story Bob was since she wanted to add her math class to her schedule like how Bob added his time at his job to his schedule. She was also similar since she treated her exam date as an on going project that she must continuously study for like how Bob used the scheduler to allocate time to accomplish his work projects
- The feedback you got from the test user.
    - Be more clear that deadlines are also for exams (maybe change it to add assignment or add school work) because was confused and thought event was for a test
- **Feedback From Question Session**
    - Could be useful to add in custom study time for each assignment rather than just having generic study time

**Version 2 of Questions Asked**

    1. Expected the app to tell the user which assignment to be working on at that time instead of just generic study time
8. How did you find the scheduling process? 
    1. Found scheduling process self intuitive, but did get confused between difference between event and deadline. Thought event was for a test and deadline was for a homework assignment. 
9. How can we make this app stand out from other calendar apps such as Google Calendar?
    1. The app stands out by the way it adds study time 
10. What is one thing you would change about this app?:
    1. Having study time tell you which assignment to work on at the time rather than just having generic study time

## **Prototype Revision #1 (after Istar, Nina, Prof. Perlmutter)**

- Summarize the changes to your requirements after each test and describe why you made each change
    - Add user authentication detail; validate user input for authentication. It is part of our prototype.
    - Add time zones to stretch goals, since Prof. Perlmutter travels to conferences often.
    - Show weekly/daily view. Some users aren’t sure about the auto-scheduling given the lack of these views.
- Summarize the changes to your prototype after each test and describe why you made each change
    - We will make sure each button that is clickable is clear to avoid confusion.
    - Add a log out button, since we did not include one
    - Make clear user is editing and not retaking survey, since some are daunted by the length of survey.
    - Make language more aligned with student needs — give examples for how to use “deadline” and “event” since Nina was confused.
- Take a photo of the relevant parts of your prototype before and after the changes
    - Include 5 PAIRS of before/after photos (10 photos in total), clearly labeled

## Test Report #3 (Maral)

- A narrative describing the test
    - Started. User scrolled down and filled the sign up form. Confused get started and sign up submit button. Is presented with new survey. Choose deep work and number of hours. Presented with add deadline/event screen. Adds a deadline; fills out relevant data. Wants to add a deadline for a meeting with professor. Adds an event — “Grocery Bingo” — and adds information. “YOU MUST GO AS A CA!” Adds another event. Calendar is generated. Presented with UI. Reacts with “Damn!” Now we can change the time zone, asked about it. User also notices changing to day/week view and changing month. Clicks the user button and reads the survey. Confused about “wind-down time.” Returns to calendar. Tries to add an event. Goes back to add event screen and exits. User asks about notifications, Khanh says that notifications will be a stretch goal. User asks about sharing calendar, but Khanh explains this is not within the scope of the prototype. Directs user to change month. User clicks event. User tries to edit event. Is confused about typeability of event. Edits description and saves. Makes a new event. Add event at the same time as another event (alternative flow). Ignores conflict. Switches to day view. Reads the day schedule. Tries to change the color since they are colorblind, but we are explained the feature is not available. *Needs a mark complete feature.* Switches to week view. User asks if recommended study times are assigned. Explains they are generated. Deletes study time. User asks if you can edit study times. Explains we can. We marked a study event as completed; schedule is regenerated. Khanh explains the process for regeneration of schedule like pushing later deadlines ahead. User asks if you can control rescheduling. Khanh explains this is automatic, but you can manually rearrange. Khanh asks if you want to reschedule after every change or only if you are prompted to. User responds, only when prompted to.
- What roles did each team member play during the test?
    - Tim: wrote narrative
    - Cheyanne: revised writing
    - Madel: asks and writes answers to questions
    - Khanh: presenting the prototype
- Which user stories were activated?
    - The user story Sheyené was activated since she wanted to use the app quickly and make her schedule appealing with the use of colors on the schedule. She used the scheduler as a way to remember events that are happening even if she is busy during the time the event is happening since she wanted to know she was missing the event which evokes the user story Clementine. Since she wanted to add the Grocery Bingo to her calander which is an event for relaxation and self care so she’s using the calander to help balance her academic life with her well-being like Clementine.
- The feedback you got from the test user.
    - Needs mark complete feature to be more visible.
    - Needs color change feature.

**Version 2 of Questions Asked Modified Based on Revision of Test Procedure #1**

1. What is your impression of the app’s design and layout?: Good!
2. How do you find the process of navigating the app?: Intuitive! Process of deleting an event was not fully understandable.
3. What is the main purpose of the app? Do you think it accomplishes that purpose? : Stress less & encourage students to study. Actually incentivizes students to study &  organize their daily commitments in a way that does not feel overwhelming (can accommodate for missing a deadline).  
4. Does the app make you feel any negative feelings of confusion, frustration, or annoyance?: No! 
5. What was the most confusing part or any part where you felt stuck or lost about the app?: Log in portion — was not sure if she should provide Microsoft and Google information when she signed up. Can make it so that username and password login is instead used.
6. What features do you find the most useful about the app?: Organizing the schedule without having to put in manual study times. Rescheduling part also seems really help.
7. What features did you expect, but didn’t find?: Notification reminder, as Maral does not actually look at her schedule unless notified.
8. How did you find the scheduling process?: Pretty good and intuitive. It felt as what you would mostly see, but rescheduling portion sets it apart from other apps.
9. How can we make this app stand out from other calendar apps such as Google Calendar?: Rescheduling feature is helpful.
10. What is one thing you would change about this app?: Ability to share the calendar between users.

## **Prototype Revision #2 (after Maral)**

- Summarize the changes to your requirements after each test and describe why you made each change:
    - possible stretch goal of adding colors to event so that it can be more visually appealing to users
- Summarize the changes to your prototype after each test and describe why you made each change
    - adding a scroll bar so the user can know that they can scroll down while on the homepage.
    - Maybe add a feature to every clickable icon so users can know what they can click on.
    - We will add a visual to see that the task has been completed on the calander.
    - We can add more description for each confirmation box so the user can know exactly what will be saved when pressing save or cancel button.
- Take a photo of the relevant parts of your prototype before and after the changes

# ✅: Part 7

**Other Group’s Project: GrinNet**

- Both regular and student org can post on it
- Home Screen can scroll down and view different accounts, can view different tags
- Click on post, then you see person’s post
- Create a post, rules, only allow one attachment, can tag tags with certain posts
- Then preview post, click create post to create
- Click refresh for user to appear
- Can sort by new post or other things
- Can view profile, can view previous posts and delete it
- Can search by tags or posts in general.
- If clicked tag3 (games), everything related to games/sports will come up
- If they search up nonsense, it says no results found
- Mobile app

 **Other Group Projects Critique** 

1) Critique: What assumptions about users were identified during the critique stage?

- The assumptions are that the people using the app are anyone who has a Grinnell email
    - Users at Grinnell (students and/or teachers and student organizations)
- They authenticate based on Grinnell username

2) Imagine

(a) Which assumption(s) did you choose to expand on for this phase?

We choose to focus on the assumption that the person who wants to interact with the app has a current Grinnell email. 

(b) How might that assumption exclude users?

The assumption of them being Grinnell students could exclude users who have already graduated if their Grinnell email is deleted and people in the Grinnell town who might still want to interact with Grinnell College students. 

(3) Design: What are your ideas for redesigning your product based on critique?

Add a guest mode. Guest accounts can view temporarily after being invited by a Grinnell student. They can post, but any posts will automatically enter a moderation queue, requiring approval. This is to minimize risks associated with students not affiliated with the college.

**Our Project Critique** 

1) Critique: What assumptions about users were identified during the critique stage?

 The assumption that the people using our app can see and aren’t color blind.

2) Imagine

(a) Which assumption(s) did you choose to expand on for this phase?

Visually-impaired people might not be able to properly interact with our app.

(b) How might that assumption exclude users?

- Blind people cannot access our app, so implementing a screen reader may be useful for that concern
- Colorblind people are not able to fully use our app.

(3) Design: What are your ideas for redesigning your product based on critique?

implementing a setting to change the color would be useful and keeping in mind design decisions that’ll work well with screen reader softwares.
