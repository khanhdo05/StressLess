# Sprint Review 1

During this sprint, we accomplished tasks that were more on the experimentation, setting up, and prototyping. 

## Sprint Review Questions

- How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective?
    - Our product has clearly progressed from a customer perspective as our team was able to implement feedback from various stakeholders to improve the features and the interface of the prototype, as suggested by our prototype session feedback.
- Describe in terms of high-level features that a non-technical user could recognize and appreciate.
    - See the section titled “Customer-visible progress.”
- What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?
    - See the section titled “Customer-invisible progress.”

## Customer-visible Progress

Our customer-visible progress consisted of two waves of prototype revisions. Prototype Revision #1 was implemented following Istar and Nina’s prototype sessions. In this prototype revision, we decided to add the following features:

Requirements Changes:

- User Authentication: Validation of user input for authentication.
- Different Views: Implementation of daily and weekly views in addition to the main monthly view as some user audiences prefer these views to see their auto-scheduled study and break times.
- Time Zones (Stretch Goal): Addition of different time zones to the calendar to accommodate traveling students.

Prototype Changes:

- Buttons: Making the buttons more obvious to avoid confusion among future testers using our prototype.
- Log Out Button: Addition of the Log Out button to allow users to log out of their account.
- Option to “Edit” Survey: Option to edit the survey instead of retaking it must be clear as some users may be less inclined to edit their survey if they believe that they need to retake the whole survey again.
- Language: Adding of more context to the “Deadline” and “Event” features, as stakeholder Nina found the distinction between them to be confusing.

Following the implementation of Prototype Revision #1, stakeholder Maral tested the new prototype. After her prototype session, Prototype Revision #2 was implemented, where we decided to add the following features:

Requirements Changes:

- Event Colors (Stretch Goal): Addition of colors to each event so that the events could be distinguishable and visually appealing.

Prototype Changes:

- Scroll Bar: Addition of a scroll bar so users are aware that they are able to scroll down while on the homepage.
- Distinguishing Buttons/Icons: Differentiation made specifically for clickable icons (i.e. different colored paper, addition of an icon, etc.) so that users are aware of which buttons/icons are clickable and which ones are not.
- Task Completion: Addition of a visual indicator which allows user to see which tasks have been completed (i.e. strikethrough text, checkbox, etc.)
- Confirmation Box: Adding of more context to the confirmation boxes to allow users to know what will be saved when they press the “Save” button.

The changes made to our product in Prototype Revisions #1 and #2 indicate the progress made to our Customer-visible progress for this sprint.

## Customer-invisible Progress

Our customer-invisible progress for this sprint consists of three main components. Firstly, we created a Trello Board for this sprint, which we used to track our project issues and to-do tasks. Throughout the sprint, we each added issues to our board to help us keep track of what we needed to do or what we needed to fix for this sprint. Secondly, we had a group discussion in which we talked about the technology we intend to use when we build our project in future sprints. We made the major decision of switching from a mobile app to a web app as we decided this would be the easiest choice to get our team on board with the technologies quickly since not all of us are experienced in app development. Overall, we decided to use React for the frontend framework, NodeJS and Express for the backend, and TypeScript for the language across both ends. Lastly, we set up a monorepo for our project. To create the monorepo, we engaged in the following steps:

1. Set up the backend with Node.js and Express and test a basic endpoint.
2. Set up frontend with React TypeScript.
3. Set up a TypeScript code formatter to ensure styling is consistent for all six group members.
4. Organized our repo with a [`README.md`](http://README.md) file that walks each group member through each step of how to set up the frontend and backend technologies.
5. Store the error log in a Markdown file.
6. Organized agile documents in Markdown files.

This concludes the progress made for this sprint in terms of customer-invisible progress.
