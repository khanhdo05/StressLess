StressLess

# Capacity - 2 Weeks Sprint

Since this is the first sprint, we do not have previous sprint to compare to. We will be using the following capacity for this sprint:

- **Tim (10 hours)**: Usually very busy until Wednesday. This Wednesday will be extra busy since I need to do a CA event. My Greek Ethics seminar is also ramping up the reading to about 60 pages per class day (2x a week). Thursdays to Sundays are less busy for me, and I can meet some time outside of class during these times (except 11am-12pm, 2-4pm, and after 7pm on Thursdays).
- **Alyssa (15 hours):** Slighty busy, but probably have a good amount time to work on this.  Can meet anytime after 6:30 pm M and T, after 4 pm on W,  before 11:30 am or 2:30-4 pm on T and TH, 4-5 on F, and can prob mostly do anytime Sa or Su.  Can also meet in mornings before 11 am M, W, and F.
- **Nifemi: (10 hours):** Flexible schedule, prefer to meet after 4pm during weekdays and anytime weekends.
- **Khanh (20 hours):** Free to meet from 4:00 - 8:00 PM every day except for Wednesday and Thursday. Do not have much stuff going on so can contribute a good amount of time on this sprint.
- **Madel (10 hours):** Basically free after 4PM on most days. Can make the time to work on this very flexibly.
- **Cheyanne(10 hours):** Mostly free, mondays: busy in the morning 10 to 12;  free from 12 to 2pm every MWF; class on T/TH from 2:30pm to 4 otherwise free those days; typically free after 4pm everyday

# Goals

The outcomes we plan on completing in this sprint are heavily focused on improving requirements, creating and testing prototypes, and getting feedback from stakeholders. We will be focusing more on the planning and design of the project in this sprint and less on the technical development side. In terms of programming, we will make sure we get the basic technology set up and that everyone can get started on setting up their environment and running the application on development mode locally.
